# abstract-line-art-python
Random lines? Random colors? Introducing, coded art!

An animation of some cool abstract lines that change color after touching the edges of the canvas.
In order to create this I imported the dudraw python package documentation - https://kwertyops.github.io/dudraw/index.html

Hope you enjoy! Feel free to use for inspo, good luck.
